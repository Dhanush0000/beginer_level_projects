# Beginner Java Projects

Welcome to the Beginner Java Projects repository! This collection of projects is designed to help you learn and practice your Java programming skills. Each project is simple yet effective in teaching key concepts of Java. As you progress through the projects, you will get a solid foundation in Java development, covering topics such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
2. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: A good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans can make working with Java more efficient. However, you can also use a simple text editor like VSCode or Sublime Text.

To check if you have Java installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```
java -version
```

If you don't have Java installed, you can download the JDK from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).


## How to Run the Projects

Each project is stored in its own folder. To run any project:

1. **Clone or Download** the repository to your local machine.
   
   You can clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/beginner-java-projects.git
   ```

   Or download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

2. **Navigate** to the project folder you want to run.

3. **Compile and Run** the Java program.

   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder containing the Java file.
   - Compile the Java file using:

     ```bash
     javac ProjectName.java
     ```

   - Run the compiled Java program:

     ```bash
     java ProjectName
     ```

   For example, to run the **Hello World** project, navigate to the folder and run:

   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   java HelloWorld
   ```
